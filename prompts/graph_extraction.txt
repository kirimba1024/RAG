Extract knowledge graph triples. Format: (Entity1, relation, Entity2)

RULES:
- Extract ONLY explicit or clearly implied relationships
- Use type/class names, not variable names (UserService, not service)
- Skip uncertain relationships
- Focus on architectural relationships (uses, extends, implements)
- Both entities must appear in text OR AST structure
- Use AST structure to understand code organization and relationships
- AST provides structural information: classes, methods, imports, inheritance

SCHEMAS:

CODE: has_method, extends, implements, uses, calls, returns, imports, instantiates, annotated_with
AST: inherits, overrides, calls_method, accesses_field, implements_interface, defines_class, defines_method
DOCS: provides, requires, uses, describes, part_of, depends_on
CONFIG: connects_to, exposes, depends_on, has_setting, runs_on

Input:
{text}
